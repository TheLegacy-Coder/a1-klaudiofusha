This project shows my ability to create a portfolio-like webpage that contains several styled HTML elements. They include paragraphs, bulleted lists, tables, headers, etc. I was also able to style everything through a separate CSS file, which ensures that proper design practices were implemented. Styling the page took quite a while, as well as coming up with a cool animation.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added the following rules in the CSS file (class names tied to tags in index.html):
  - .info-body: contains rules for entire page
  - h1, h2: contains rules for the headers
  - p: contains rules for paragraphs
  - ul: contains rules for the overall list
  - li: contains rules for the list elements
  - .about-me: contains rules for the about section of the page
  - .linkedin-link: contains rules for the LinkedIn link right below the about me
  - .major-div: contains rules for the overall major div
  - .wpi-majors: contains rules for the majors themselves
  - .table-div: contains rules for the table div
  - .courses-taken-table: contains rules for the table itself
  - .table-headers: contains rules for the table headers
  - .table-row-X: contains rules for the individual table rows
  - .audio-elem: contains rules for the audio element
  - .tech-exp-div: contains rules for the tech experience div
  - .tech-experience: contains rules for the tech experience list
  - .working-experience: contains rules for the work experience list
  - .softeng-demo: contains rules for the iframe component (embedded YouTube video)
  - .cycling-text: contains rules for the cycling text animation at the bottom of the page
- **JavaScript Animation**: Added text at the very bottom of the webpage that resizes automatically and cycles through the colors contained within the color palette. 
- **Extra Tags**: `table`, `progress`, `link`, `a`, `iframe`, `audio`. These tags allowed me to make the page look a little better while also having some fun.

## Design Achievements
- **Color Palette Created**: See file called 'Assignment1A Color Palette.png' which is in the project folder. Palette created using Adobe. I have also pasted it below:

- **Used the Madimi One Font from Google Fonts**: I used Madimi One as the font for the primary copy text in my site. You can find it at the following link: https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Madimi+One?query=Madimi+One
