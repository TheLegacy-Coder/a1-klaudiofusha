This project shows my ability to create a portfolio-like webpage that contains several styled HTML elements. They include paragraphs, bulleted lists, tables, headers, etc. I was also able to style everything through a separate CSS file, which ensures that proper design practices were implemented.

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the overall content body, h1 and h2, ul, p, li, about-me, LinkedIn profile link, and the Soft Eng demo video. Also styled div elements that allowed me to change font color of titles. Styled table elements as well.
- **JavaScript Animation**: Added text at the very bottom of the webpage that resizes automatically and cycles through the colors contained within the color palette.
- **Extra Tags**: <table>, <progress>, <link> (using <a> tag), <iframe>, <audio>

## Design Achievements
- **Color Palette Created**: See file called 'Assignment1A Color Palette.png' which is in the project folder.
- **Used the Madimi One Font from Google Fonts**: I used Madimi One as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
